# Deep Probabilistic Models with applications in astronomy

In this tutorial we will review the basics of inference with probabilistic models, the more recent "deep" probabilistic models and how to implement them using the [Pyro probabilistic programming library](http://docs.pyro.ai/en/stable/getting_started.html). 

After that we will have a hands-on experience training probabilistic models to analyze time series from astronomical survey projects.

To install the dependencies I suggest to use conda:

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    
And then launch 

    jupyter notebook
    
And navigate to `tutorial.ipynb`
